It results in extreme thirst and frequent urination of insipid, or dilute and odorless, urine. A healthy adult will typically urinatebetween 1 and 3 quarts (946.4 milliliters to 2.84 liters)of urine a day. People with diabetes insipidus may eliminate as many as 20 quarts (18.9 liters) of urine daily. There are several types of diabetes insipidus, and they can often be treated successfully. Keep reading to learn more about this condition. Diabetes insipidus is not related todiabetes mellitus(often referred to simply as diabetes), and it does not affect your blood sugar levels. This means you can have diabetes insipidus without having diabetes. In fact, diabetes insipidus can occur in anyone. The word “insipid” means flavorless, and a primary symptom of diabetes insipidus is urine that’sclearand odorless. On the other hand, the word “mellitus” means sweet. Diabetes mellitus gets its name from the fact that a primary symptom of diabetes issweet-smelling urine. The main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are: Possible symptoms in infants and young children include: Adults can experience some of the above symptoms, plus: Diabetes insipidus can also causesevere dehydration, which can lead toseizures,brain damage, and even death if left untreated. Contact a doctor immediately if you oryour childare experiencing these symptoms. Diabetes insipidus can occur when any part of the system that regulates fluid in your body breaks down. It’s closely associated with low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH levels affect how well yourkidneysconserve water. To understand diabetes insipidus, it helps to understand how your body normally uses and regulates fluids. Fluids make up around 50 to 60 percent of an adult’s overall body mass and around 75 percent of an infant’s, according toStatPearls. Maintaining the proper amount of fluid in your body is key to your overall health. Consuming water and food throughout the day helps provide fluid to your body. Urinating, breathing, andsweatinghelp eliminate fluid from your body. Your body uses a system of organs and hormone signals to regulate body fluids. It makes less urine when you need to replace fluid lost to sweating and makes more urine when there’s too much fluid in your body. In addition: There are four types of diabetes insipidus: Central diabetes insipidus is the most common type of diabetes insipidus. It’s caused by damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. This damage means ADH cannot be produced, stored, or released normally. Without ADH, large amounts of fluid are released into the urine. Central diabetes insipidus is often the result of: Nephrogenic diabetes insipiduscan be genetic or acquired. Certain genetic mutations candamage the kidneys, leaving them unable to respond to ADH. Other possible causes of the kidney damage — and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus — include: Thekidneysare made up of small structures called nephrons. Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by dysfunction of the thirst mechanism in the hypothalamus. This dysfunction can cause you to feel excessively thirsty and drink too much liquid. Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus has also been associated with certain medications and conditions, including mental health conditions. Gestational diabetes insipidus only occurs during pregnancy. It can take place when an enzyme made by theplacentadestroys a person’s ADH. The placenta plays an important role in the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the fetus and the parent. Gestational diabetes insipidus can also occur when increased levels ofprostaglandin, a hormone-like chemical, makes the kidneys less sensitive to ADH. The condition should resolve after pregnancy. A doctor will talk with you about your symptoms and determine which tests are necessary. They may use several tests for diagnosis. Your doctor will take a sample of your urine to test for salt and other waste concentrations. This is known as aurine specific gravity test. If you have diabetes insipidus, your urine sample will have a high concentration of water and a low concentration of other waste. Your urine specific gravity results wlll be low. You’ll be asked to stop drinking water for a specified period of time before the water deprivation test. You’ll then give blood and urine samples, and your doctor will measure changes in: In addition to measuring your ADH levels, your doctor may give you synthetic ADH during the test to see if your kidneys respond as expected to ADH. The water deprivation test is performed under close supervision, and certain people may require hospitalization to ensure it’s performed safely. During anMRI, a machine takes an image of your brain tissue using magnets and radio waves. Your doctor will then look at these images to see if there’s any brain tissue damage that’s causing your symptoms. Your doctor will also look closely at images of your hypothalamus or pituitary gland for any damage or abnormalities. Genetic screening may be performed to look for an inherited form of diabetes insipidus based on yourfamily history. Treatment will depend on the type of diabetes insipidus you’re diagnosed with and the severity of your condition. In mild cases, your doctor may simply recommend that you increase your water intake. Desmopressin (DDAVP, Nocturna) is an artificial hormone that’s often used to treat central diabetes insipidus. It’s a synthetic form of ADH. It’s available as a pill, a nasal spray, or an injection. While taking this medication, it’s important to regulate your water intake and drink only when you’re thirsty. If your diabetes insipidus is caused by another condition such as a tumor or an issue with the pituitary gland, your doctor will treat that condition first and then determine if the diabetes insipidus still needs to be treated. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, addressing the underlying cause may cure the problem. Other treatments include: When taking these medications, it’s important to drink water only when you’re thirsty. If your diabetes insipidus is the result of medications you’re taking, your doctor will work with you to replace or stop taking these medications. Do not stop taking any medication without talking with your doctor first. There’s no specific treatment for dipsogenic diabetes insipidus, but treating symptoms or primary mental health conditions may bring relief. Gestational diabetes insipidus does not typically require treatment. Desmopressin may be prescribed for severe gestational diabetes insipidus. Lifestyle changes are vital to the treatment of diabetes insipidus. The most important action is avoiding dehydration. You can do this by bringing water with you wherever you go or offering water every few hours to your child if they have diabetes insipidus. Your doctor will help you determine how much fluid you should be drinking each day. Carry a medical alert card in your wallet or wear a medical bracelet so that others know about your diabetes insipidus in case of an emergency. Dehydration can happen quickly, so those around you should know of your condition. Your outlook depends on the underlying cause of your diabetes insipidus. When diabetes insipidus is treated properly, the condition does not typically cause any severe or long-term complications.

About30 millionpeople in the United States have diabetes, a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. Between90 and 95 percentof people with diabetes have type 2, which can develop at any age. Management of this disease is crucial. When blood sugar levels aren’t well-controlled, your risk of developing hearing loss may increase. Read on to learn more about the connection between type 2 diabetes and hearing loss and what you can do about it. Studies show that hearing loss istwice as commonin people who have diabetes than in those who don’t. In a2008 study, researchers analyzed data from hearing tests of adults between the ages of 20 and 69. They concluded that diabetes may contribute to hearing loss by damaging nerves and blood vessels. Similar studies have shown a possible link betweenhearing lossand nerve damage. The study’s authors made no distinction between type 1 and type 2, the two main types of diabetes. But almost all participants had type 2. The authors also cautioned that noise exposure and presence of diabetes was self-reported. In 2013,researchersanalyzed studies carried out from 1974 to 2011 on diabetes and hearing loss. They concluded that people with diabetes were twice as likely to have hearing loss than people without diabetes. However, these researchers did note several limitations, such as the data being based on observational studies. What causes or contributes to hearing loss in people with diabetes isn’t clear. It’s known that high blood sugar can damage blood vessels throughout the body, including your ears. If you’ve had diabetes for a long time and it isn’t well-controlled, there could be damage to the vast network of small blood vessels in your ears. Researchsuggests that women with diabetes may experience greater hearing loss than those without the disease. This also applies to women with well-controlled diabetes. Another complication of diabetes is nerve damage. It’s possible that damage to the auditory nerves could lead to hearing loss. More research is needed to fully understand the link between diabetes and hearing loss. The risk factors for hearing loss in people with type 2 diabetes are also unclear. You may be more likely to have hearing loss if you’re having a hard timemanaging blood sugar levels. That’s why it’s so important to follow your diabetes treatment plan, monitor your condition, and see your doctor regularly. If you do have both diabetes and hearing loss, it doesn’t necessarily mean that one has anything to do with the other. There are a variety of other reasons you may be losing your hearing. These include: Learn more: Age-related hearing loss » Hearing loss can be so gradual that you may not notice it. Children and adults can experience hearing loss at any time. Ask yourself the following questions if you think you might be losing your hearing: If you answered yes to more than one of these questions, you should have your hearing tested to assess it and prevent further damage. Doctors will start with a physical examination of your ears to see if there’s an obvious blockage, fluid, or infection. A tuning fork test can help your doctor detect hearing loss. It can also help determine if the problem is with nerves in the middle ear or inner ear. Depending on the results, you may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist or audiologist. Another diagnostic tool is the audiometer test. During this test, you’ll put on a set of earphones. Sounds in different ranges and levels will be sent to one ear at a time. You’ll be asked to indicate when you hear a tone. Hearing aids are the most common treatment option for hearing loss, and you’ll find many on the market to choose from. Your doctor can help you select the best option for your lifestyle needs. Other treatments for hearing loss depend on the cause and may include: Surgery may be necessary if your hearing loss is due to: If you’re prescribed new medications, be sure to ask about potential drug interactions. Although it’s unclear if there’s a link between diabetes and hearing loss, it’s a good idea to share information between your doctors. That way, they’ll each have a better picture of your overall health. Certain forms of hearing loss are temporary. Early treatment may be a key factor in recovery. For at least some forms of hearing loss, people with diabetes or high blood pressure have alower rateof recovery. Your outlook depends on the cause of your hearing loss and treatment. Once you have a diagnosis and your doctor can evaluate your overall health, they should be able to give you a better idea of what to expect. If you have diabetes, you should have your hearing checked each year.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Blurry vision means it’s harder to make out fine details in what you’re seeing. Blurry vision can be an early sign of diabetes. For those who have a diagnosis of diabetes, blurry vision can indicate your blood sugars are too high or not in target range. The reason your sight blurs may be fluid leaking into the lens of your eye. This makes the lens swell and change shape. Those changes make it hard for your eyes to focus, so things start to look fuzzy. You may also get blurry vision when you start insulin treatment. This is due to shifting fluids, but it generally resolves after a few weeks. For many people, as blood sugar levels stabilize, so does their vision. Read on to learn more about the possible causes of blurry vision with diabetes. High blood sugar levels, orhyperglycemia, result from glucose building up in the blood when the body lacks enough insulin to process it. Besides blurry vision, other symptoms of hyperglycemia include: Higher blood sugars and averageA1C levelscan mean ahigher riskof diabetes-relatedcomplications, including eye health issues such as: One diabetes eye complication isdiabetic retinopathy. It affectsmore than 1 in 3 peoplewith diabetes, no matter the type they have. A symptom of diabetic retinopathy is blurry vision. Thestages of diabetic retinopathyinclude: Most people don’t have symptoms of diabetic retinopathy until it has progressed to a later stage. Besides blurry vision, symptoms may include: While diabetic retinopathy can’t be reversed, treatment alongside diabetes management can stabilize it. You might also have blurry vision if you’re developingcataracts. People with diabetestend to developcataracts at a younger age than other people. Cataracts cause the lens of your eyes to become cloudy. Other symptoms include: Blurry vision can also be a symptom ofglaucoma, a disease in which pressure in your eye damages the optic nerve. According to theNational Eye Institute, if you have diabetes, your risk of glaucoma is double that of other adults. Other symptoms of glaucoma may include: The macula is the center of the retina. It’s the part of the eye that gives you sharp central vision. Macular edema is when the macula swells due to leaking fluid. Other symptoms of macular edema include wavy vision and color changes. Diabetic macular edema (DME)stems from diabetic retinopathy. It usually affects both eyes. According to the National Eye Institute,1 in 15 peopleliving with diabetes will develop DME. Diabetes increases the risk of a variety of eye problems. It’s important to manage your blood sugar, follow all medications and directions for testing, and have regular health checkups and eye exams. This should include a comprehensive eye exam with dilation every year. Be sure to tell your doctor about all of your symptoms, as well as all the medications you take. It’s possible that addressing fluctuating glucose levels can make symptoms like blurry vision fade away. But if you’re experiencing this symptom, it could also indicate diabetic retinopathy. This may require treatment, including the potential forlaser therapyormedicated eye injections. Your eye doctor is the best professional to consult to assess your eye health and treat it as needed. Blurry vision is just one symptom of diabetic retinopathy. It’s not a guarantee you have this condition. Several issues related to diabetes or your medications can affect your vision. It could also indicate another health issue or condition. Consulting healthcare professionals is a good first step to determine whether you need to visit your eye doctor for more examinations or treatment. Not necessarily. While blurry vision could be a sign you’ve developed diabetic retinopathy, that’s not a guarantee. And just because you have diabetic retinopathy does not always mean you need laser therapy or eye injections. An eye care team specializing in diabetes eye health can best determine what’s needed for you. Blurry vision can be a minor problem with a quick fix, such as eye drops or a new prescription for eyeglasses. However, it can also indicate a serious eye disease or an underlying condition other than diabetes. That’s why it’s best to report any blurry vision and other vision changes to your doctor. In many cases, early treatment can correct the problem and prevent it from getting worse. Read this article in Spanish.

https://www.healthline.com/health/type-1-5-diabetes,What to Know About Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA),"Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is an autoimmune condition also known as type 1.5 diabetes. People with LADA follow similar T1D practices with insulin, eating, exercise, and blood sugar management. Type 1.5 diabetes is commonly known as LADA, or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. Thistype of diabetes shares characteristics of both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes. As an autoimmune condition that develops during adulthood, LADA is not tied to lifestyle habits or eating patterns, as T2D often is. This type of diabetes may set in more gradually than T1D, which often develops suddenly with fast-rising blood sugar levels and related symptoms. With LADA, people may have a longer period of time before needing insulin. With a diagnosis taking place during adulthood, LADA may bemisdiagnosedas T2D even for those who do not present the common symptom of obesity. Typical LADA symptoms are similar tothose for T1Dbut may be more gradual and less extreme at first. They may include: If LADA isn’t diagnosed and is left untreated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), an emergency situation where the body can’t use sugar as fuel and instead starts burning fat for energy. This produces ketones, which are toxic to the body. This is considered a medical emergency that may require urgent care and hospitalization. An estimated2% to 12%of adult-onset diabetes diagnoses are LADA, though estimates vary given thedifferent criteriaused to define the condition and how itoverlapsso much with both T1D and T2D. The American Diabetes Association’s yearly guidelines point out that despite the controversy on how LADA is defined and diagnosed, it’s acommon and acceptable termthat many use in the clinical community. People who have LADAtend to meetthe following criteria: Your healthcare and diabetes care team can order a number of different lab tests to help diagnose diabetes, which is the same for determining other types of diabetes. One test that may be different is an antibody test. Healthcare professionals use this test to determine if you have an autoimmune reaction in your body that helps determine your type of diabetes. Research shows thatas many as 40%of people 30 years and older with type 1 diabetes may have initially been misdiagnosed with T2D. Treatments for T2D, includingmetformin, may temporarily manage blood sugar levels and other diabetes symptoms until the pancreas stops making insulin. This is often the point at which many who have received a T2D diagnosis become frustrated with how treatment is no longer working effectively. As a result, they may receive a new LADA diagnosis and realize that they may have had that type of diabetes all along. LADA develops when your body does not make enough insulin and eventually stops producing that critical hormone. While you may be able to treat LADA with oral medications at first (similar to T2D), you will eventually need to take insulin. The time that change occurs may be different for everyone, but people with LADA typically require insulinwithin 5 yearsof diagnosis. Establishing a diabetes care plan from there is the same as it would be for anyone with T1D. This includesthe basics: Like any type of diabetes, your risk for developing diabetes-related complications is often tied to blood sugar levels. Genetics may also play a role, but higher blood sugar and A1C levels over time raises the risk of complications. This can include the most common diabetes complications: People receiving a diabetes diagnosis during adulthood may have a form of adult-onset diabetes called LADA. This type of diabetes may have a slower onset than traditional T1D, but it eventually requires insulin and daily management like T1D.

About11.6% of people in the United Stateslive with the condition.Type 2 diabetesis the most common form you may have heard of, but you might be surprised by what you still don’t know. Ongoing research in recent years has improved diagnosis, treatment, and knowledge about type 2 diabetes, allowing for better prevention and management. We’ve partnered withStelo by Dexcomto bring you this article covering six things everyone should know about type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a condition that occurs when your body has difficulty managing its blood sugar levels. It’s due to the body’s inability to useinsulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. If your body can’t use insulin to metabolize glucose, a simple sugar, it will build up in your blood, leading to high blood sugar levels. As a result of cellular resistance, the various cells in your body won’t get the energy they need to function properly, causing further problems. Diabetes is a chronic condition. Currently, there’s no cure, so it takes careful management and sometimes medication to keep blood sugar levels within their target range. Worldwide, the mortality rate due to diabetes rose by 3% between 2000 and 2019,according to the World Health Organization. Even more concerning is that type 2 diabetes was once only seen in adults but is now more and more commonly diagnosed in young adults as well. Many cases of type 2 diabetes are undiagnosed because of a lack of symptoms or because people don’t recognize them as diabetes symptoms. Causes of symptoms such as fatigue, increased hunger, and increased thirst are sometimes hard to pin down and often develop over a long period of time, if at all. For this reason, it’s especially important to get tested. Anyone35 or oldershould get screened for diabetes. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases even has a freediabetes risk testthat will help you see if you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes. If you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes, monitoring your glucose levels may help you spot early warning signs and take action before you develop serious health issues.

If left undiagnosed and untreated for too long, type 2 diabetes can lead to life threatening complications. The same is true for people whose diabetes is not managed properly. Cardiovascular disease, diabetic eye disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, hearing damage, and increased risk for stroke andAlzheimer’s diseaseare among the major complications that people with type 2 diabetes face. Maintaining a close watch on blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and blood pressure is extremely important in lowering these risks. Early detection and treatment, a healthy lifestyle, and regular checkups are key. It’s not completely understood why diabetes occurs in certain people and not others, but research shows that some groupsface a higher risk. The following are potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes: One of the most important things you can do to manage type 2 diabetes and live a full life is to eat well and exercise regularly. Because experts know definitively that certain factors increase the risk, they also know that there’s a good chance you can prevent it or at least delay the onset. Some basic things you can do to helpprevent or manage type 2 diabetesinclude: If you’re struggling with changing up your eating habits, here’s a tip from Vadym Graifer, author of “The Time Machine Diet,” a book that details Graifer’s personal journey with type 2 diabetes: “Watch out for added sugar. It’s creeping in our diet from everywhere. A majority of processed foods contain it; if it’s in the box, it’s likely to contain sugar. No matter how busy your life is, find the way to prepare and eat real food instead of artificial concoctions overloaded with flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and, as the popular saying goes, anything your grandma wouldn’t recognize as food.” Experts also say it’s vital to remember that while your doctor may prescribe medication to help you manage diabetes, you shouldn’t make the mistake of assuming that a pill can fix everything. “People think that because their doctor gave them a medication to control their blood sugar that they no longer have diabetes. This is false,” says integrative podiatristDr. Suzanne Fuchs, DPM. “These patients often feel as though they can take the medication and not watch what they eat or exercise.” Foram Mehta is a San Francisco-based journalist by way of New York City and Texas.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Diabetes can increase your risk for many health conditions, includingstroke. People with diabetes aretwice as likelyto have a stroke as people without diabetes, according to the American Stroke Association. They’re also more likely to have a stroke at an earlier age, and the outcomemay be worse. If you have prediabetes, you already have a higher risk of heart disease and stroke than people without diabetes. Diabetes affects the body’s ability to createinsulinor use it properly. Since insulin plays an important role in pulling glucose into cells from the bloodstream, people withdiabetesoften havetoo much sugarin their blood. Over time, this excess sugar can contribute to the buildup of clots or fat deposits inside vessels that supply blood to the neck andbrain. This process is known asatherosclerosis. If these deposits grow, they can cause a narrowing of the blood vessel wall or even a complete blockage. Any interruption to the blood supply in the brain will stop blood and oxygen from reaching brain cells. This can lead to a stroke. Without rapid treatment, a stroke can result in permanent cell damage or death. A stroke can also result if bleeding occurs in the brain. The maintypesof stroke are: Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain is blocked, most often by ablood clot. About87%of strokes are ischemic strokes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. Around10% to 20%of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes. The risk of severe complications or death is higher than with an ischemic stroke. People with diabetes have ahigher riskof small bleeds in the brain, known as cerebral microbleeds. A TIA is sometimes called aministrokebecause the blood flow to the brain is blocked for a shorter amount of time and doesn’t result in permanent neurological injury. A TIA is a type of ischemic stroke. It may last from a minute to several hours — until the clogged artery reopens on its own. People often refer to a TIA as a “warning stroke.” Around15%of people who have a stroke have previously had a TIA. If you think someone has had or is having a TIA, seek help at once. Recognizing thesigns and symptomsof a stroke is a crucial first step to getting help. Early help can lower the risk of severe complications. Other symptoms that can signal a stroke include sudden: If you think you’re experiencing a stroke, call 911 or your local emergency services immediately.A stroke is a life threatening condition. To help people remember how to recognize a stroke, the American Stroke Association endorses the mnemonicFAST, which stands for: Treatment will depend on the type of stroke. Treatment for an ischemic stroke includes: Treatment for a stroke that results from bleeding in the brain will involve: There is no specific treatment for a TIA, but doctors will recommend measures to lower the risk of a stroke. This is essential because20%of people who have a TIA go on to have a stroke within 3 months. Around half of these happen in the 2 days after the TIA. Options include: The risk factors for stroke include: Many people with diabetes have another condition, such as obesity or cardiovascular problems. These further increase the risk. Lifestyle risk factors include: The risk is also higher for Black and Hispanic Americans,researchsuggests. Socioeconomic factors, such as reduced access to health insurance and education, may play a role. It’s not always possible to avoid a stroke, but some actions can help reduce the risk. Here are some tips: High blood pressureandhigh cholesterolcan increase your risk of stroke. You might be able to reduce yourblood pressureandcholesterollevels by making changes to your diet. Try the following tips: Doing moderate-intensityexercisefor2 hours and 30 minutesper week can help reduce your risk of stroke and other diseases. Examples of exercises that get your body moving are: If yousmoke, ask a doctor aboutsmoking cessation programsor other things you can do to help you quit smoking. People who smoke have ahigher riskof stroke than those who don’t smoke. If you drink alcohol, try to limit your intake to no more thantwo drinksper day for males or one per day for females. Some medications help reduce the risk of a stroke. These include: If a doctor prescribes these medications, be sure to take them as they recommend. Factors affecting the outlook include: People who can get to the emergency room within3 hoursof symptoms starting are less likely to have severe consequences than those who receive later treatment, according to the CDC. If a person has a TIA, they may not have any adverse effects, although there’s a20%risk of having another stroke within 3 months. An ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke can be life threatening. If the person survives, they may experience long-term problems with various functions, including: Statistics suggest that in high-income countries, such as the United States, an ischemic stroke is fatal within 30 days in around15%of cases overall. Around 25% to 30% of hemorrhagic strokes are fatal in high-income countries, such as the United States, but this figure can rise to48%in some countries. The complications of a hemorrhagic stroke include seizures and ongoing problems with the brain, lungs, and cardiovascular system. Anyone who appears to be having a stroke needs immediate medical assistance. It’s essential to call 911 or seek emergency medical services as soon as possible. High blood sugar levels increase the chance of fatty deposits or clots developing in the blood vessels. These can block the flow of blood and prevent oxygen from reaching the brain. People with diabetes also have a higher risk of small bleeds in the brain, which could lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. The symptoms of a diabetic stroke are the same as for any stroke. They include problems with speech, a sudden and severe headache, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, dizziness, loss of balance, and vision problems. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels are below70 milligrams per deciliter. It’s potentially life threatening and can affect people with diabetes who are using insulin. Symptoms include confusion, a loss of consciousness, and seizures. It can also cause paralysis and speech problems. These symptoms can resemble those of a stroke. People with diabetes have a higher risk of a stroke than those without. Also, they’re more likely to have a stroke at a younger age, and the outcome may be more severe. If you have diabetes, one way of lowering your risk of a stroke is to follow any treatment plan for managing blood sugar levels. People with diabetes can also take the same steps as those without diabetes, such as avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and getting regular exercise.

The condition usually develops slowly, sometimes over the course of several decades. If you have diabetes and notice numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in your hands or feet, see a doctor or healthcare professional, as these are early symptoms ofperipheral neuropathy. The danger is usually when you can’t feel pain and anulcerdevelops on your foot. In cases of severe or prolonged peripheral neuropathy, you may be vulnerable to injuries or infections. In serious cases, slow wound healing or infection can lead toamputation. Different types of diabetic neuropathy affect different areas of the body and cause a variety of symptoms. If you havediabetes, it’s important to regularlycheck your blood glucose levelsand contact a doctor if you have any symptoms of neuropathy. It’s common for symptoms of neuropathy to appear gradually. In many cases, the first type of nerve damage to occurinvolvesthe nerves of the feet. This can lead to the symptom of sometimes painful “pins and needles” in your feet. Symptoms vary depending on the areas affected. Common signs and symptoms of the different types of diabetic neuropathy include: The term neuropathy is used to describe several types of nerve damage. In people with diabetes, there are four main types of neuropathy. Themost commonform of neuropathy is peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy usually affects the feet and legs, but it can also affect the arms or hands. Symptoms are varied and can be mild to severe. They include numbness, tingling or burning sensations, and muscle weakness. If you have peripheral neuropathy, you may not feel an injury or sore on your foot. People with diabetes often havecompromised blood circulation, which makes it more difficult for wounds to heal. This combination increases the risk of infection. In extreme cases, infection can lead to amputation. The second most common type of neuropathy in people with diabetes isautonomic neuropathy. The autonomic nervous system runs other systems in your body over which you have no conscious control, such as the digestive and cardiovascular systems and organs such as the sex organs and bladder. Nerve damage to the digestive systemmay cause: Gastroparesiscausesa delay in digestion, which can worsen over time, leading to frequent nausea and vomiting. Typically, people with gastroparesis feel full too quickly and are unable to finish a meal. Delayed digestion often makes it more difficult to control blood glucose levels, too, with frequently alternating high and low readings. Also, symptoms ofhypoglycemia, such as sweating and heart palpitations, can go undetected in people with autonomic neuropathy. This can meannot noticingwhen you have low blood sugar, increasing the risk of a hypoglycemic emergency. Autonomic neuropathymay also causesexual problems such as erectile dysfunction, vaginal dryness, or difficulty achievingorgasm. Neuropathy in the bladder can causeincontinenceor make it difficult to fully empty your bladder. Damage to the nerves that control your heart rate and blood pressure can make them respond more slowly. You may experience a drop in blood pressure and feel light-headed or dizzy when you stand up after sitting or lying down or when you exert yourself. Autonomic neuropathy can also cause an abnormally fast heart rate. Autonomic neuropathy can make it difficult to identify some of the symptoms of a heart attack. You may not feel any chest pain when your heart isn’t getting enough oxygen. If you have autonomic neuropathy, you should know the other symptoms of a heart attack,including: Proximal neuropathy, also known as diabetic amyotrophy, is rare. This form of neuropathy ismore commonin adults over 50 years old with type 2 diabetes and is diagnosed more often in men. It often affects the hips, buttocks, or thighs. You may experience sudden and sometimes severe pain. Muscle weakness in your legs may make it difficult to stand up without assistance.Diabetic amyotrophyusually affects only one side of the body. After the onset of symptoms, they usually get worse and then eventually begin to improve slowly. Most people recover within a few years, even without treatment. Focal neuropathy, ormononeuropathy, occurs when there’s damage to one specific nerve or group of nerves, causing weakness in the affected area. This occurs most often in your hand, head, torso, or leg. It appears suddenly and is usually very painful. Like proximal neuropathy, most focal neuropathies go away in a few weeks or months and leave no lasting damage. The most common type iscarpal tunnel syndrome. Although most don’t feel the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome,about 25%of people with diabetes have some degree of nerve compression at the wrist. Symptoms of focal neuropathy include: Diabetic neuropathy is caused by highblood sugar levelssustained over a long period of time. Other factorscan leadto nerve damage, such as: Low levels of vitamin B12can also leadto neuropathy. Metformin, a common medication used to manage diabetes, can decrease levels of vitamin B12. You can ask a doctor for a simple blood test to identify any vitamin deficiencies. A doctor will determine whether or not you have neuropathy, starting by asking about your symptoms and medical history. You’ll also have aphysical examination. They’ll check your level of sensitivity to temperature and touch, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tone. A doctormay doa filament test to test the sensitivity in your feet. For this, they’ll use nylon fiber to check your limbs for any loss of sensation. A tuning fork may be used to test your vibration threshold. A doctor may also test your ankle reflexes. In some cases, they may also perform anerve conduction study, whichcan assessnerve damage by measuring the speed and strength of nerve signals. There’s no cure for diabetic neuropathy, but youcan slowits progression. Keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range is the best way to decrease the likelihood of developing diabetic neuropathy or slow its progression. It can also relieve some symptoms. Quitting smoking, if applicable, and exercising regularly are also parts of a comprehensive treatment plan. Always talk with a doctor or healthcare professional before beginning a new fitness routine. You can also ask a doctor aboutcomplementary treatmentsorsupplements for neuropathy. Medicationsmay be usedto treat pain caused by diabetic neuropathy. Talk with a doctor about the available medications and their potential side effects. Several medications have been shown to help with symptoms. You may also want to consider alternative therapies, such asacupuncture. When used in conjunction with medication, alternative therapies may provide additional relief. Depending on your type of neuropathy, a doctor can suggest medications, therapies, or lifestyle changes that may help you manage symptoms and prevent complications. For example, if you have problems with digestion as a result of your neuropathy, a doctormay suggestyou try eating smaller meals more often and limit the amount of fiber and fat in your diet. If you have vaginal dryness, a doctor may suggest a lubricant. If you haveerectile dysfunction, they may prescribe medication that can help. Peripheral neuropathy is very common in people with diabetes and can lead toserious foot complications, which in turncan leadto amputation. If you have peripheral neuropathy, it’s important to take special care of your feet and to get prompt medical help if you have an injury or sore. Diabetic neuropathycan oftenbe avoided if you are careful aboutmanaging your blood glucose. To do this, it can help to be consistent in: If you do develop diabetic neuropathy, work closely with a doctor and follow their recommendations for slowing its progression.

https://www.healthline.com/health/type-1-diabetes-causes-symtoms-treatments,What Is Type 1 Diabetes?,"Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that means people cannot make insulin in their bodies naturally. As a result, they can’t regulate blood sugar levels as well as those without the condition. This means they must inject insulin to keep their blood sugar levels in target range and manage other aspects of life, including diet, exercise, sleep, and mental health. People with T1D may develop complications over time, which can lead to other challenges in managing this condition and life in general. The following arecommon T1D symptoms: Thesymptoms of type 1 diabetesmay not always be clear, especially for parents who may not immediately recognize these symptoms in their children. T1D can resemble the flu, and they can misunderstand it as a typical effect related to busy school or sports activities. With adults, they can mistake T1D for the same effects from everyday stress, work, and life situations. But T1D can develop suddenly and become life threatening in a short amount of time, becoming a medical emergency that might lead to coma or worse. You can watch for thesecommon symptomsas warning signs for type 1 diabetes. You may need to seek emergency medical care. Researchers don’t know the exact cause of type 1 diabetes. What they know is that T1D involves anautoimmune reaction, in which the body attacks and kills the insulin-making cells in the pancreas for some reason. Geneticsplays a rolein that process. T1D may be passed down through generations of a family, though it’s unclear how the pattern works and why some people in a family will develop diabetes while others will not. Researchers have identified certain gene variants that may increase a person’s risk. A parent and child may share these variants between them, generation after generation. However, not everyone who has these genes develops the condition. For example, identical twins with the same genes may or may not develop the condition. If one twin has T1D, the other twin develops the conditionhalf the timeor less. This suggests that genes aren’t the only factor. Researchers also believe there may be environmental causes that play a part in this T1D development. This might include traumatic experiences, including the flu or other viruses and illnesses (including COVID-19), which appear to tip the scales over that line toward T1D development. Whatever the reasons, this leads to the body not being able to make insulin itself. Insulinis a hormone that helps your body’s cells use glucose (sugar) for energy. Your body gets glucose from the food you eat. Insulin allows glucose to pass from your blood into your body’s cells. When the cells have enough, your liver and muscle tissues store the extraglucosein the form of glycogen. It’s broken down into blood sugar and released when you need energy between meals, during exercise, or while you sleep. With T1D, your body is unable to process glucose due to the lack of insulin. Glucose from your food can’t make its way into your cells. This leaves too much glucose circulating in your blood. High blood sugar levels can lead to both short- and long-term complications. Healthcare professionals usually diagnose through a series of tests. Some may be quick in a doctor’s office, while others may require bloodwork at a separate lab or even hours of preparation or monitoring in a hospital. A healthcare professional candiagnose T1Dif: When blood sugar gets so high thatdiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)occurs, a person can become very ill. This is often the reason people end up in the hospital or their doctor’s office and they receive a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. If you have any of the symptoms of diabetes, your doctor will likely order tests. Doctors also use the same criteria to diagnose type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes sometimes receive amisdiagnosisas having type 2 diabetes. This may be more common in adults, who could have T1D that sometimes develops more gradually. A doctor may not realize that you’ve received a misdiagnosis until you begin developing complications or worsening symptoms despite treatment. Type 1 diabetes is not the same as type 2 diabetes or other types, though they can mirror each other in many ways — from the symptoms to insulin treatment and daily blood sugar checks to certain diabetes complications that may develop over time. There are a handful of diabetes types, but the main types are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here are some of the key differences between T1D and T2D, in particular: Experts historically viewed T1D as “juvenile diabetes” because it most often affected children. It is an outdated term and doesn’t reflect the reality that T1D can occur at any age. Just because someone is an adult displaying diabetes symptoms does not mean they have T2D. For people withtype 2 diabetes, their body stops responding and using insulin as well as it should to move glucose from the blood into the cells despite having adequate levels of the hormone. Eventually, their bodies may stop making adequate insulin entirely. Type 1 diabetes develops very quickly, and symptoms are obvious. For people with type 2 diabetes, the condition can develop over many years. A person with type 2 diabetes may not know they have it until they have a complication. Another type of diabetes calledLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)is sometimes referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. People may receive a misdiagnosis of type 1 diabetes instead of LADA, which may develop more gradually. A qualified medical professional can help correctly diagnose the type of diabetes, along with your input if you feel that you may be experiencing T1D or LADA. If you receive a T1D diagnosis, your body can’t make its own insulin. You’ll need to take insulin to help your body use the sugar in your blood. This may mean taking insulin through injections with a syringe and glass vial, a prefilled plasticinsulin pen, or using a fast-actinginhaled insulin called Afrezza. Some people may also choose to use a device known as an insulin pump, which attaches to your body and delivers insulin more constantly throughout the day and night through a small cannula inserted through the top layer of skin. Some people find using aninsulin pumpmore convenient than sticking themselves with a needle, and this device may also provide more flexibility and the ability to adjust insulin doses at different times to balance out blood sugar levels. Insulin itselfcan be expensive, no matter how you choose to administer it. The same applies to insulin pens, pumps, and other diabetes supplies needed to take insulin and manage your condition. People with insurance may check their healthcare coverage and plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, to determine what types of insulin are best covered and how much they may cost. The amount of insulin someone with T1D needs varies throughout the day and night. Managing blood sugars and tracking how much different foods and drinks affect your blood sugar levels, along with exercise and other factors, can help you and your diabetes care team determine how much insulin you may need. Several types ofinsulinexist. Your doctor may have you try more than one to find what works best for you. Diabetes managementhas many parts, beyond just taking insulin. This condition means constant management of blood sugar levels, which can rise or fall as a result of many factors. Just some of those reasons can include: Type 1 diabetes can lead to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). People can manage both, but these can also become more severe and require immediate treatment. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar is too low, usually when the body has too much insulin. It can happen if you wait too long to eat or have a snack, or if you exercise too much. Some of the most common low blood sugarsymptomsmay include: Conversely,hyperglycemiais high blood sugar. Depending on the level of hyperglycemia, it can cause you to feel sluggish, unfocused, or even sick. If blood sugars get too high and you don’t have enough insulin in the system, this can lead to potentially dangerous DKA.Symptomsmay include: Pregnancy presents unique challenges for people who have type 1 diabetes. However, it’s possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby despite having this condition. The most important thing to remember if you are expecting or trying to become pregnant and have type 1 diabetes is that everything you do for yourself, you do for your baby. People who have high blood sugar levels have babies with high blood sugar. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood sugar levels during pregnancy can lead to complications such as: If you have type 1 diabetes and want to become pregnant or find out that you’re pregnant, talk with your doctor immediately. They can discuss any changes you may need to make to guarantee your blood sugar levels remain stable and safe for you and your baby. It’s best to plan ahead for pregnancy and discuss your diabetes and blood sugar goals with your doctor. During your pregnancy, you will likely need to see a healthcare professional more frequently. You may also need to adjust medication and insulin throughout the pregnancy. Yes, you can drink alcohol if you live with type 1 diabetes. However, it’s important to know that alcohol canaffect your blood sugar levels in a big wayin the short term. Over time, excessive alcohol use can contribute to diabetes complications. The liver processes and removes alcohol from the body. The liver also helps manage blood sugar levels. If you have T1D and drink alcohol, your liver slows down how it manages blood sugar in order to address the alcohol in your system. This can lead to low blood sugar immediately and for several hours after drinking. It’s important to test your blood sugar before drinking alcohol and to continue to monitor it afterward. Over time, high blood sugar levels can cause damage to various parts of the body. Symptoms can include: Diabetes can also damage your nerves and lead to a condition calleddiabetic neuropathy. This is common in the feet. Small cuts, especially on the bottom of your feet, can quickly turn into severe ulcers and infections, especially if blood sugar levels aren’t controlled. This is because you can’t feel or see the cuts, so you don’t treat them. That is why it’s important to check your feet regularly if you have diabetes. If you happen to notice any foot injuries, let your doctor know right away. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which a person’s body is unable to process glucose due to a lack of insulin. Experts believe it is influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and possibly by viral infections. This condition requires insulin and daily blood sugar management, including balanced eating and an exercise routine. When monitoring blood sugars and overall management, you may also want to consider your mental health, sleeping patterns, and medications. You can lower your risk of long-term diabetes complications by keeping blood sugars and A1C levels in the target range. It’s important to consult with your doctor and healthcare team on managing diabetes and glucose levels regularly. Read this article in Spanish.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. A diabetes eye exam or screening may include imaging tests, a dilated eye exam, and looking at letter charts on a wall to check for diabetes-related eye complications. A diabetes eye exam involves several tests to look for signs of damage to the blood vessels supplying the retina. This is the light-sensitive portion of the back of your eye. Any damage to these blood cells and the retina may indicate a diabetes-related eye complication, themost commonbeing diabetic retinopathy. As the damage worsens, you may begin losing your vision. Your eyesight may become blurry, less intense, and begin to disappear. According to theAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA), diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness in people ages 20 to 74 years in the United States and other developed countries. As such, regular diabetes eye exams are a crucial part of your diabetes management plan. They can help a doctor detect any eye complications early and form a treatment plan to reduce the risk of any further vision loss. Keep reading to learn more about diabetes eye tests, who they’re for, how to prepare, and how often you should get them. A diabetes eye exam may include several different tests, depending on the progression and severity of your condition. According to the ADA, the examination may include the followingfour types of tests: A healthcare professionalmay alsouseoptical coherence tomography (OCT)to detect diabetes eye complications like diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. This test uses light waves to create 3D images of your retina, which can help a doctor examine the thickness of your retinal layers. A diabetes eye exam can help a doctor detect any possible diabetes-related complications that can affect your eyes. The most common complication isdiabetic retinopathy. It affects around75%of people withtype 1 diabetesand 25% of people withtype 2 diabetes. A diabetes eye test will also look for other complications,such as: All of these eye conditions may cause blurry vision. If left untreated, however, they can lead to severe vision loss, which may progress tototal blindnessand impact your quality of life. Diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms in the early stages. You may barely notice theinitial symptoms. Speak with a doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms: Diabetic retinopathy often affects both eyes equally. If you’re experiencing issues with only one eye, it doesn’t mean you don’t have diabetic retinopathy. But it might indicate another eye issue. The best way to handle eye problems related to diabetes is to detect retinal abnormalities early, monitor them regularly, and treat them promptly. Early detection and treatment begin with the retinal exam. TheADArecommends: Type 2 diabetes often goesundetectedand undiagnosed for years. Retinopathy may have already begun during that time, so an eye exam will help your doctor determine if you already have damage. The ADA recommends having a diabetes eye exam each year after the first exam. In more serious cases, however, you may require an eye exam every2 to 4 months. If you receive a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, it’s important to follow your treatment plans for both diabetes and retinopathy carefully. Unmanaged diabetic retinopathy may lead to severe complications, such as vision loss. You may also have to monitor your eyes for the rest of your life. A healthcare professional can help you manage your condition and will help decide how many eye exams you need yearly. Come to your appointment prepared to talk about what you’ve been experiencing. Write down the following details and bring them with you: A doctor will likely have several questions and information for you. Be sure you’re prepared with a list of questions you have about what you’ve been experiencing and what the next steps might be. During a diabetes eye exam, an optometrist or ophthalmologist will ask you about your eyesight, any symptoms you may be experiencing, and how you’remanaging your blood sugar levels. They willfirst performa visual acuity test to measure your eyesight and see if any changes have occurred since your last exam. You will be asked to read letters on a chart in front of you. The eye specialist will then apply eye drops to dilate your pupils. These can sting temporarily and blur your vision. Once the eye drops are working, you will be asked to prop your chin up and forehead against a machine, with which the eye specialist will take photographs of your eyes. These will be sent to a laboratory for examination. A doctor mayalso wishto use aslit lamp testto examine the back of your eyes. This will involve propping your chin and forehead up against a mount while a doctor uses a small circular glass piece to examine your eyes. A diabetes eye exam may take up to30 minutes. If a doctor applied drops into your eyes, you may experience blurry vision and sensitivity to light for afew hoursafter the test. Consider asking someone to join you for the appointment so they can help you return home safely. Wearing sunglasses may also help with bright lights. A healthcare professional will give you the results of your diabetes eye exam and discuss any possible next steps. Several components of a general sight and diabetes eye exam are similar.

Though insulin resistance and diabetes are not the same, they are related, and one can influence the other. Treatment may depend on what’s causing insulin resistance and if you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes. Insulin resistance and diabetes are closely related. But not everyone who is insulin resistant has diabetes, and not all people with diabetes are insulin resistant. However, insulin resistance increases your chances of developing both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, in particular. This article explains the similarities and differences between insulin resistance and diabetes. Though interconnected, they are quite different. Both are tied to your body’s ability to make or useinsulin, a key hormone that allowsglucoseto enter the body’s cells from the bloodstream to be used for energy. When someone hasprediabetesor diabetes or is developinginsulin resistance, their body cannot correctly create or use insulin as it naturally would. If your body has to secrete more insulin than usual to manage blood sugar levels adequately, then you have insulin resistance. Many people are insulin resistant but do not have diabetes. Over time, insulin resistance canlead toprediabetes and, if not reversed, can lead totype 2 diabetes. The development of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes occurs when the body is so insulin resistant that the pancreas can no longer make enough insulin to maintain usual blood sugar levels, and your cells are not responding to the insulin your body is secreting. People with diabetes need to manage theirblood sugar levelswith diet, exercise, and sometimes prescription medications like metformin or insulin. Insulin resistance does not lead totype 1 diabetes. In this autoimmune condition, the body’s immune system has destroyed the insulin-making beta cells of the pancreas, and thus no insulin is being made in the body. But people with T1D can become insulin resistant over time, which makes managing blood sugar levels more difficult. The symptoms of insulin resistance can go undetected for years and are not as evident as those experienced when someone has developed diabetes. You may be developing insulin resistance if you experience the following: However, some symptoms of insulin resistance may also include: Insulin resistance can make managingyour blood sugar levelsmuch harder and keep them within a healthy range. It can also lead to chronically high blood sugar and A1C levels, increasing your risk for long-term diabetes complications. Insulin resistance will require you to take more insulin (if you take exogenous insulin) or your body to secrete more insulin for the foods you eat daily. This can also lead to weight gain, complicating aspects of your diabetes management, including exercise and maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Excess body fat in the form of obesity, especially in the abdomen and around the organs (also known as visceral fat), is theleading causeof insulin resistance. Losing excess body weight and being active are the best ways to reduce insulin resistance and lower your chances of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Yes, you can. A 2021 study found that40% of adultsin the United States have insulin resistance. Many of those people also had either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Many people experience insulin resistance for years before developing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes; some may never develop those later conditions. Being insulin resistant, however, is the primary cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. If you are insulin resistant, you should consult your doctor about ways to reverse it to prevent health complications later in life. The primary ways to reverse insulin resistance include losing excess body weight, eating a diet as recommended by a doctor, and becoming physically active. Talk with your doctor about developing a meal plan that can meet your health goals and ways to incorporate more physical activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)recommendsthat most adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, or at least 30 minutes per day most days of the week, along with at least two days per week of strength training exercises. If you’re feeling unwell, contact your doctor. If you’re experiencing the following symptoms (symptoms of diabetes), seek medical attention immediately: Insulin resistance and diabetes are closely related, but they are not the same. Insulin resistance is a broader term meaning that your body has to secrete more insulin than usual to manage blood sugar levels. A diagnosis of diabetes is when your blood sugar levels reach a high enough threshold due to the body’s inability to produce enough insulin. Many people are insulin resistant but do not have diabetes, but being insulin resistant can lead to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. You may want to consult your doctor or healthcare team if you’re experiencing the signs and symptoms of insulin resistance. This can be important to help treat before a diabetes diagnosis.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. It allows your body to use glucose for energy. Glucose is a type of sugar found in many carbohydrates. The body processes glucose like this: Insulin also helps balance your blood glucose levels. When there’s too much glucose in your bloodstream, insulin tells your body to store the leftover glucose in your liver. The stored glucose isn’t released until your blood glucose levels decrease. Your blood glucose levels may decrease between meals or when your body is stressed or needs an extra boost of energy. Diabetesoccurs when your body doesn’t use insulin properly or make enough insulin. There are two main types of diabetes: Injections of insulin can help manage both types of diabetes. The injected insulin acts as a replacement for, or a supplement to, your body’s natural insulin. People living with type 1 diabetes can’t make insulin, so they must inject insulin to control their blood glucose levels. Many people living with type 2 diabetes can manage their blood glucose levels with lifestyle changes and oral medication. However, if these treatments don’t help control glucose levels, people living with type 2 diabetes may also need supplemental insulin. All types of insulin produce the same effect. They mimic the natural increases and decreases of insulin levels in the body during the day. The makeup ofdifferent types of insulinaffects how fast and how long they work. The type of insulin you’ll be prescribed will vary depending on things like: Talk with a doctor about the right insulin for you and your lifestyle. Insulin is most commonly administered through a syringe,insulin pen, orinsulin pump. The type of insulin injection you use will be based on your personal preference, health needs, and insurance coverage. Your doctor or diabetes educator will show you how to give yourself the injections. You can inject the insulin under the skin in many different parts of your body, such as your: Your doctor will likely also explain the importance of changing where on your body you inject insulin to prevent lumps or fatty deposits from forming at the injection site. Both syringes and insulin pens use a small needle to inject insulin into your body. There are pros and cons to each, and which one you ultimately end up with will depend on your lifestyle and your doctor’s advice. Things to know about insulin syringes: Things to know about insulin pens: There are two ways to get your insulin without using a syringe or needle. Your doctor will decide which option best meets your personal needs. Like food, insulin doesn’t have a forever shelf life. It’s recommended that you store any insulin you’re not using in the fridge. However, injecting cold insulin may make the injection feel more painful. Because of this, a best practice is to keep the bottle of insulin you’re currently using in a safe place, away from direct heat and sunlight. Insulin kept at room temperature can last about a month. Do not store insulin in the freezer, and always check the expiration date before using it. Side effects from injecting or receiving insulin are rare, but can occur in certain cases. The symptoms of mild allergic reactions are swelling, itching, or redness around the injection area. More severe insulin allergies may include nausea and vomiting. In either case, talk with your doctor if you notice any of these signs. Hypoglycemia, or blood glucose levels that are too low, can sometimes occur when you take insulin. It’s important to balance the insulin that you give yourself with food or calories. If you exercise longer or harder than usual or don’t eat the right amount of calories or carbs, your glucose level can drop too low and trigger low blood sugar. Symptoms of low blood sugar include: Typically, a blood glucose reading of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) is considered too low for almost anyone using insulin, but you should talk with your doctor about what is too low for you. To treat hypoglycemia (less than 70mg/dL or the level your doctor has said is too low for you), carry at least 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates with you at all times. That’s about equal to any of the following: People living with type 1 diabetes must use insulin to help control their blood sugar, but those living with type 2 diabetes may be able to use oral medications to help manage their blood sugar instead of injections. Oral medication is typically prescribed along with lifestyle changes, such as increased activity, weight loss (if applicable), and diet changes. Medications for type 2 diabetes are designed to lower blood glucose levels, but they may not work for everyone. Typically, they work best for people who have recently developed diabetes and do not use supplemental insulin. Some medicationsinclude: Before prescribing any of these oral medications, your doctor will talk with you about your medical history and any additional medications you take. If you’re living with diabetes (type 2 or type 1), taking insulin can help keep your blood glucose level within the recommended range. There are a few ways to take insulin, from syringes to insulin pens, to an insulin pump, or even with an inhaler. Maintaining blood glucose levels helps reduce the risk ofdiabetes complications, such as blindness and the loss of limbs. In addition to insulin and oral medications, lifestyle changes can help prevent your blood glucose level from getting too high. Whether you’ve been prescribed insulin or have just recently been diagnosed with diabetes, talk with your doctor about ways to make your treatment as effective as possible.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. If you receive a prediabetes diagnosis, it means you have a higher-than-normal blood sugar level. But it’s not high enough to qualify as a diagnosis ofdiabetes. According to a 2014 review, long-term data suggest that lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of prediabetes progressing to diabetes for as long as10 years. A 2019 study showed that5% to 15%of people’s prediabetes progresses to diabetes every year. Prediabetes can also lead to other health conditions, including heart disease and stroke. But you can reverse prediabetes. Read on to learn more about this diagnosis and what you can do. A doctor or healthcare professional mayreferto prediabetes as the following: Prediabetes has no clear symptoms. Some people may experience a condition called acanthosis nigricans, which is a sign of insulin resistance. Itinvolvesthe development of dark, thick, and often velvety patches of skin. It can be associated withpolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This discoloration usually occurs around your: If you’ve received a diagnosis of prediabetes, it’s important to talk with a doctor if you experience: These are symptoms typical of type 2 diabetes and may indicate that your prediabetes has progressed to type 2 diabetes. A doctor can order a series of tests to confirm this. Your pancreas releases a hormone called insulin when you eat so that sugar from your blood moves into the cells of your body and serves as an energy source. That’s how insulin helps lower your blood sugar level. The causes of prediabetes are similar to those of diabetes, though they’re at an earlier stage. They primarily consist of: A normal fasting blood glucose level is99 mg/dLor less, while hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is under70 mg/dL. If you have prediabetes, your fasting blood glucose levels will rise to100 to 125 mg/dL. Once your fasting blood glucose level goes above 125 mg/dL, you’ll receive a diagnosis of diabetes. Prediabetes can occur in anyone, but certain factors can increase your chances of developing the condition. Researchsuggeststhat prediabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle factors and genetics. Here are some of the main risk factors for prediabetes: According to the CDC, losing even just5% to 7%of your body weight if you have overweight can significantly lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Other factors, including high stress levels and smoking, can also contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Making lifestyle changes is one of the most effective ways to keep up a moderate weight and prevent type 2 diabetes. Here are a few tips to get started: A doctor will need to order a blood test for an accurate diagnosis. This means drawing a blood sample to send to a lab. Results can vary depending on the type of test. You should take the same test twice to confirm the diagnosis, according to theNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Devices that measure your glucose levels, such as the finger-stick test, aren’t used for diagnosis. Instead, a doctorwill useone or two of these tests: Thehemoglobin A1C test, which is also called the A1C test or glycosylated hemoglobin test, measures your average blood sugar level over the last 3 months. This test doesn’t require fasting and can be done any time. An A1C value of 5.7% to 6.4% is diagnostic for prediabetes. A second A1C test is recommended to confirm the results. The higher the A1C, the higher the risk that your prediabetes will progress to type 2 diabetes. During a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, a doctor will ask you to fast for 8 hours or overnight. Before you eat, a healthcare professional will take a blood sample for testing. A blood sugar level of 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) also requires fasting. A doctor will check your blood glucose levels twice, once at the beginning of the appointment and then 2 hours later after you drink a sugary drink. If your blood sugar level reads 140 to 199 mg/dL after 2 hours, then the test indicates IGT, or prediabetes. Treating prediabetes can also be thought of as preventing type 2 diabetes. If a doctor gives you a diagnosis of prediabetes, they’ll recommend certain lifestyle changes. A study called the Diabetes Prevention Program showed an approximate58%reduction of risk in people who kept up with these changes in the long term. The most common ways to manage prediabetes are: Some people with diabetes choose to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments to manage their condition. CAM treatments can include taking supplements,meditation, andacupuncture. Always check with a doctor before starting any CAM treatments because they may interact with your medication. Researchsuggests that alow-carbohydrate dietcould help improve your blood glucose management, insulin resistance, and weight. Although most available research is focused on type 2 diabetes rather than prediabetes specifically, it may be fair to assume that a low carbohydrate diet could also be beneficial for those with prediabetes. Low-carbohydrate diets generally restrict your carbohydrate intake to less than26%of total daily calories, or about 130 g of carbohydrates per day. Talk with a doctor before making major changes to your diet. If you don’t get treatment, prediabetes can develop into type 2 diabetes and other conditions, such as: The good news is that prediabetes is reversible with long-term lifestyle changes. Prediabetes is reversible. You can prevent or slow the development of prediabetes and diabetes by making lifestyle changes, including keeping up a moderate weight. According to one 2017 review, each 2.2 lbs. of weight loss could lower the risk of type 2 diabetes by16%for people with IGT, or prediabetes. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes the following: Be sure to include plenty of nutrient-dense, whole foods in your diet and limit your intake of highly processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can be especially beneficial to help you reach your health goals. You can lower your risk of diabetes by regularly staying active. Doing 30 minutes of any activity that raises your heart rate to your target rate, such as walking, most days of the week is recommended. Ways to incorporate physical activity into your daily schedule can include: Getting 30 minutes of exercise per day and losing 5% to 7% of your weight can lower your risk of type 2 diabetes progression by more than58%, according to the CDC. If left untreated, prediabetes can cause several health issues, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But it’s reversible and can be treated by making lifestyle changes. In addition to following a health-promoting, well-rounded diet, getting regular physical activity and taking medications as prescribed by a doctor can help prevent prediabetes from progressing.

If you have diabetes, your risk of developingcardiovascular diseaseis more than double that of the general population, according to theAmerican Heart Association. For people with type 2 diabetes, heart disease is the most common cause of death. There are a number of things you can do to lower your risk of heart disease. Understanding the connection between diabetes and heart disease is the first step toward prevention. The high glucose (sugar) levels in the blood of people with diabetes can eventually damage blood vessels as well as the nerves that control them. Body tissues typically use sugar as an energy source. It’s stored in the liver as a form of glycogen. If you have diabetes, sugar can stay in your bloodstream and leak out of the liver into your blood, with subsequent damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control them. A blocked coronary artery can slow or stop blood from supplying oxygen and nutrients to your heart. The risk of heart disease increases the longer you have diabetes. Monitoring blood sugar is an important part of properly managing diabetes. Check levels with a self-monitoring device according to your doctor’s instructions. Keep a journal of your levels and bring it to your next medical appointment so that you and your doctor can review it together. The following are some additional factors that can increase your risk of heart disease if you have diabetes. High blood pressure is one of the most common risk factors for heart disease among people with diabetes. It places strain on your heart and damages your blood vessels. This makes you more susceptible to a variety of complications including: If you have both diabetes and high blood pressure, you’re at least twice as likely to develop heart disease as people without diabetes. The simplest way to manage your blood pressure is to adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and if needed, take medications as your doctor prescribed. Poorly managed levels of blood fats like cholesterol and triglycerides are common in people with diabetes. They can also increase the risk of developing heart disease. Too much LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and not enough HDL (“good”) cholesterol may cause a buildup of fatty plaque in your blood vessels. This can create blockages and lead to having a heart attack or stroke. Although in many cases genetics influence cholesterol levels, you can still manage and improve your levels by making healthy lifestyle choices and maintaining a regular exercise routine. People with diabetes are more likely to have overweight or obesity. Both conditions are risk factors for heart disease. Obesity has a strong influence on: Weight loss can reduce the risk of heart disease. One of the most effective ways to manage your weight is to work with a dietitian or nutritionist to create a healthy eating plan. Regular exercise also plays an important role in weight management. Having a sedentary lifestyle can seriously increase heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and obesity. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)recommends that every adult get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week. Examples include: The CDC also recommends doing strength-training exercises at least twice a week on nonconsecutive days. Talk with your doctor to find out which exercises might be best suited for your fitness needs. If you have diabetes and you’re a smoker, your risk of developing heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Both cigarette smoke and diabetes create a buildup of plaque in the arteries, which causes them to narrow. This can result in a variety of complications, ranging from heart attack and stroke to foot problems. In severe cases, foot problems can even lead to amputation. Remember that it’s never too late to quit. Ask your doctor about which smoking cessation methods might work best for you. The symptoms of heart disease may vary based on its severity. Some people experience no symptoms at all. These are some of the most common symptoms: To help prevent heart disease if you have diabetes, try to follow a heart-healthy diet, which can help reduce your overall cholesterol and blood pressure, among other benefits. Examples of heart-healthy foods include: Try to limit your intake of: Always try to opt for low fat options in grocery stores or at restaurants. Death due to cardiovascular disease is70 percent higher in adults with diabetesthan in those without it, the CDC reports. About 32 percent of people with type 2 diabetes have heart disease, according to a2017 study. At least 68 percent of people with diabetes ages 65 and older will die from some form of heart disease, according to the American Heart Association. People under the age of 65 with diabetes also have a significantly higher risk of: There are ways to help prevent heart disease if you have diabetes. To do this, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recommends themanage your diabetes “ABCs”: In addition to recommended that you eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat heart disease if you have diabetes. Talk to your doctor before taking over-the-counter medications to treat heart disease. Some may interact with your diabetes medication, or they may contain sugar and other carbohydrates that can affect your blood sugar level. The following are examples of medications your doctor may prescribe: If you have diabetes and untreated heart disease, you could have serious complications such as: You can have a heart attack if part of your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood due to diabetes damaging the vessels. After experiencing a heart attack, people with diabeteshave a greater risk of heart failurethan people who don’t have diabetes. The symptoms of a heart attack may include the following: If you’re experiencing these symptoms, call 911 right away. If you have diabetes, the excess sugar in your blood may eventually block your blood vessels, preventing blood from reaching your brain. This can cause a stroke. People with diabetes are1.5 times more likelyto have a stroke than those without diabetes. The risk factors for heart disease and stroke are similar. Those factors include having: The following are some symptoms you may suddenly experience if you’re having a stroke: Call 911 immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. Successful treatments usually work only up to 3 hours after a stroke occurs. People with diabetes have a greater risk of developing heart failure, which is caused by the heart’s inability to pump enough blood to the body. Heart failure is one of the most serious cardiovascular complications of diabetes. These are some of the symptoms of heart failure: See your doctor if you have these symptoms. Although heart failure can’t be cured, it can be successfully treated with medications or surgery. If you have diabetes and are experiencing heart disease symptoms such as pain or pressure in your chest, shortness of breath, or fatigue, you should see your doctor right away. They may recommend making lifestyle changes and eating a healthy diet. They may also prescribe medications. These recommendations could save your life. Now that you have a better understanding of the connection between heart disease and diabetes, it’s time to take action. Whenever possible, eat healthy, stay active, and do your best to manage your blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Having diabetes doesn’t mean you’ll also develop other conditions, such as heart disease. You have the power to manage your own risk factors and improve your heart health through lifestyle changes and working with your doctor to create a treatment plan that’s right for you.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. What is diabetic nephropathy? Diabetic nephropathy is a type of progressive kidney disease that may occur in people who have diabetes. It affects people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and risk increases with the duration of the disease and other risk factors like high blood pressure and a family history of kidney disease. Over40 percentof cases of kidney failure are caused by diabetes, and it’s estimated that approximately 180,000 people are living with kidney failure caused by complications of diabetes. Diabetes is also themost commoncause ofend-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is the fifth and final stage of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy progresses slowly. With early treatment, you can slow or even stop the progression of the disease. Not everyone who develops diabetic nephropathy will progress to kidney failure or ESRD, and having diabetes does not mean you will develop diabetic nephropathy. The early stages of kidney damage often do not cause noticeable symptoms. You may not experience any symptoms until you are in the late stages of chronic kidney disease. Symptoms of ESRD may include: Each of your kidneys has about one million nephrons. Nephrons are small structures that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can cause the nephrons to thicken and scar, which make them less able to filter waste and remove fluid from the body. This causes them to leak a type of protein called albumin into your urine. Albumin can be measured to help diagnose and determine the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The exact reason this occurs in people with diabetes is unknown, but high blood sugar levels and high blood pressure are thought to contribute to diabetic nephropathy. Persistently high blood sugar or blood pressure levels are two things that can damage your kidneys, making them unable to filter waste and remove water from your body. Other factors have been shown to increase your risk of getting diabetic nephropathy, such as: If you have diabetes, your doctor will mostly likely perform yearly blood and urine tests on you to check for early signs of kidney damage. That is because diabetes is a risk factor for kidney damage. Common tests include: A microalbuminuria urine test checks for albumin in your urine. Normal urine does not contain albumin, so the presence of the protein in your urine is a sign of kidney damage. A BUN blood test checks for the presence of urea nitrogen in your blood. Urea nitrogen forms when protein is broken down. Higher than normal levels of urea nitrogen in your blood may be a sign of kidney failure A serum creatinine blood test measures creatinine levels in your blood. Your kidneys remove creatinine from your body by sending creatinine to the bladder, where it is released with urine. If your kidneys are damaged, they cannot remove the creatinine properly from your blood. High creatinine levels in your blood may mean that your kidneys are not functioning correctly. Your doctor will use your creatinine level to estimate your glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which helps to determine how well your kidneys are working. If your doctor suspects that you have diabetic nephropathy, they may order a kidney biopsy. A kidney biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small sample of one or both of your kidneys is removed, so it can be viewed under a microscope. Early treatment can help slow down the progression of kidney disease. There are five stages of kidney disease. Stage 1 is the mildest stage and kidney functionality can be restored with treatment. Stage 5 is the most severe form of kidney failure. At stage 5, the kidney is no longer functional, and you will need to have dialysis or a kidney transplant. Your glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be used to help your doctor determine the stage of your kidney disease. Knowing your stage is important because that will affect your treatment plan. To calculate your GFR, your doctor will use the results from a creatinine blood test along with your age, gender, and physique.  There is no cure for diabetic nephropathy, but treatments can delay or stop the progression of the disease. Treatments consist of keeping blood sugar levels under control and blood pressure levels within their target range through medications and lifestyle changes. Your doctor will also recommend special diet modifications. If your kidney disease progresses to ESRD, you will require more invasive treatments. Regularly monitoring your blood sugar levels, using proper dosages of insulin, and taking medications as directed by your doctor can keep your blood sugar levels under control. Your doctor may prescribe ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or other blood pressure medications to keep your blood pressure levels down. Kerendia (finerenone)is a prescription medicine that can reduce the risk of sustained GFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with CKD associated with type 2 diabetes. Your doctor or dietitian will help you plan a special diet that is easy on your kidneys. These diets are more restrictive than a standard diet for people with diabetes. Your doctor may recommend: Your doctor can help you develop a customized diet plan. You can also work with a dietitian to help you better understand how to best balance the foods you eat. Learn more: How to manage diabetes with a carbohydrate-friendly diet » Your doctor may also recommend an exercise plan for you to help keep your blood pressure low and your kidneys healthy. If you have ESRD, you will likely need dialysis or a kidney transplant, in addition to treatments for earlier stages of kidney disease. Dialysis is a procedure that helps to filter the waste out of your blood. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Your doctor will help you decide which is best for you. The other option for treatment is a kidney transplant. For a kidney transplant, a kidney from a donor will be placed into your body. The success of dialysis and kidney transplants differs with each person. Disease progression depends on many factors. Following a treatment plan and making recommended lifestyle changes can slow the disease’s progression and keep your kidneys healthy longer.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when a person with diabetes type 1 or 2 has dangerously high levels of ketones in the body. It can be a medical emergency. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and, much less commonly, of type 2 diabetes. DKA happens when your blood sugar is very high and acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in your body. Ketoacidosis shouldn’t be confused withketosis, which is harmless. Ketosis can occur as a result of an extremely low carbohydrate diet, known as aketogenic diet, or fromfasting. DKA only happens when you don’t have enough insulin in your body to process blood sugar into energy. If this happens, your liver starts to process fat into energy, which releases ketones into the blood. High levels of ketones in the blood are dangerous. It’s less common in people withtype 2 diabetesbecause insulin levels don’t usually drop so low, but it can happen. DKA may be the first sign oftype 1 diabetes, as people with this disease can’t make their own insulin. Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly. Early symptoms of DKA can include: As DKA progresses, more symptoms may appear: DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if you think you may be experiencing DKA. If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you useinsulin, make sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in place. If you have type 1 diabetes and have a blood sugar reading of over 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), you should test yourself for ketones using a urine or blood test. You should also test if you are sick or planning on exercising and your blood sugar is 240 mg/dL or higher. Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medical help if you suspect you are progressing to DKA. People with type 2 diabetes are usually at lower risk of DKA. But the risk can increase when your body is under strain due to injury, infection, or surgery. If you have any of the following symptoms, and you can’t reach your doctor, theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)recommends getting emergency help right away: Get help by calling local emergency services or having someone take you to the nearest emergency room. The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to normalizeblood sugarand insulin levels. If you receive a diagnosis of DKA but haven’t yet received a diagnosis of diabetes, your doctor will create a diabetes treatment plan to keep ketoacidosis from recurring. Infection can increase the risk of DKA. If your DKA is a result of an infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually withantibiotics. At the hospital, your physician will likely give youintravenous (IV) fluidsto help your body rehydrate. During a DKA event, you usually lose a lot of fluids, which can reduce the amount of blood flowing through your body. Fluid replacement helps restore typical blood flow. It also helps treatdehydration, which can cause even higher blood sugar levels. When your insulin levels are too low, your body’selectrolytescan also become atypically low. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte replacement is also commonly done through an IV. Insulin will likely be administered to you through an IV until your blood sugar level falls below200 to 250 mg/dL. The emergency care team will also monitor several other blood test results that indicate when insulin therapy is no longer needed. When your blood sugar and other test readings are within an acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the future. DKA occurs when insulin levels are low. Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA, glucose can’t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood sugar levels. In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that doesn’t require insulin. Turning fat into energy produces ketones. When too many ketones build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis. The most common causes of DKA are: Risk factors for DKA include: Certain medications can increase the risk of DKA. These include: Although DKA is less common in people who have type 2 diabetes, it does occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered “ketosis-prone” and are at a higher risk of DKA. A diagnosis of ketosis-prone diabetes ismore likelyfor: It’s best to talk with your doctor about your risk factors to make sure you have the right treatment plan in place. Testing for ketones is one of the first steps for diagnosing DKA. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should have a supply ofhome ketone tests. These test either yoururineor your blood for the presence of ketones. You can buy these in drug stores or online. According to theAmerican Diabetes Association, you should test for ketones: Test your urine or blood every 4 to 6 hours. Urine test strips change color to signal the presence of ketones in your urine. You’ll need to pee on the strip or dip the strip into the pee you’ve collected in a container. The indicator on the strip will change color. Compare the test strip to the results chart. Blood ketone testers are also available. These are usually combination devices that can measure both glucose levels and ketone levels. Similar to blood glucose testing, you’ll need to apply a small sample of blood to a test strip. The test strip is inserted into a monitor device to test for the presence of ketones in your blood. A doctor or pharmacist can advise you on when and how to use your home ketone tests. A doctor will likely do a test to confirm the presence of ketones in your urine. They will usually also test your blood sugar level. Other tests your doctor may order include: There are many ways to prevent DKA. Prevention means following your diabetes treatment plan carefully and taking some extra care when you’re sick. You can lower your risk of DKA withproper managementof your diabetes: Although you can’t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a DKA emergency. A “sick day plan” can reduce the risk of DKA: Call your doctor if you detect moderate or high ketones in a home test. If you can’t reach your doctor and you suspect you may be progressing to DKA, get emergency help. Early detection is essential. DKA is serious, but it can be prevented. Follow your diabetes treatment plan and be proactive about your health. Tell your doctor if something isn’t working for you or if you’re having trouble. They can adjust your treatment plan or help you come up with solutions for better managing your diabetes. Read this article in Spanish.

Without proper management, it can lead to several potentially severe complications. There are two types of diabetes complications: acute and chronic. Acute complications require urgent care. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (the buildup of acid in your blood as a result of high blood sugar) are examples of acute complications. If left untreated, acute diabetes complications may lead to: Unmanaged diabetes may also lead to chronic or long-term complications. Over time, high blood sugar may permanently affect various organs, including: Unmanaged diabetes can also cause nerve damage. People with diabetes may experiencesudden dropsin blood sugar levels. Skipping a meal or taking a higher dose of a medication that increases insulin levels in your body may cause these drops. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include: If your blood sugar gets extremely low, you may also experience fainting, seizures, or go into a coma. Ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes that results from the body not being able to use glucose (sugar) as a fuel source. This happens when insulin levels are very low. Ketoacidosis ismore commonin type 1 diabetes. If your cells do not get enough energy, your body begins to break down fat. Fat breakdown in the body produces byproducts that can lead to toxic acids called ketone bodies. Accumulation of ketones may cause: Some diabetes complications are a result of the damage to blood vessels in your eyes. Cataractsare 2 to 5 times more likely to develop in people with diabetes. They cause the eye’s clear lens to become cloudy, blocking light from getting in. Sunglasses and anti-glare lenses can often help treat mild cataracts, while severe cataracts may require a lens implant. Glaucomaoccurs when pressure builds up in the eye and restricts blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. It causes gradual loss of vision. Compared to people without diabetes, people with diabetes aretwice as likelyto develop the most common type of glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathyis a category that includes any problems with the retina that are related to diabetes. In theearlier stages, capillaries (small blood vessels) in the back of the eye can enlarge and form pouches. This can lead to swelling and bleeding that distort vision. This condition can also advance to the proliferative form, in which damaged blood vessels of the retina close off and force new blood vessels to form. These new vessels are weak and may bleed. The proliferative form of diabetic retinopathy can lead to permanent vision loss. Macular edemaresults from diabetic retinopathy. When capillary walls lose their ability to control the passage of substances between the blood and the retina, fluid can leak into the macula, causing it to swell. The macula is the part of your eye that lets you see faces and read. Macular edemacausesblurred vision and potential loss of vision. Prompt treatment is often effective and can help prevent vision loss. Over time, high blood sugar levels can affect the kidneys’ ability to filter waste out of the body. Substances such as protein may incorrectly pass into the urine. This progressive damage to the kidneys is calleddiabetic nephropathy. Diabetes is theleading causeof kidney disease, especially if you also have hypertension (high blood pressure). If not treated, diabetic kidney disease may lead to the need fordialysis. Excess sugar inthe bloodstream candamage the nervesin different regions of the body. These can include the nerves that control automatic processes, such as digestion, andthe nerves that control your extremities, such as your feet. Neuropathy can lead to: If numbness becomes severe, you may eventually not even be able to notice an injury until a large sore or infection develops. High blood sugar levels that go untreated for a long time may damage blood vessels. Damaged blood vessels may cause problems with circulation andincrease the riskof cardiovascular complications such as heart attack and stroke. People with diabetes aremore likelyto experience skin problems because of nerve and blood vessel damage. Restricted blood flow to the extremities may also result in health challenges related to your feet. If you have diabetes, small sores or injuries in your skin may turn into deep skin ulcers. If skin ulcers get larger or grow deeper, they can lead to gangrene, which can require amputation. It is important to keep an eye for any minor lesions in your feet, so you can prevent complications. Diabetes complications related to the skin, such as bacterial and viral infections, areoften the firstsymptoms of diabetes. Diabetes can also cause specific skin conditions, such as diabetic dermopathy, diabetic blisters, and necrobiosis. Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you’ve had diabetes, the higher the chance for complications, especially if you haven’t followed a treatment plan. Preventive care can help you lessen or avoid many diabetes complications. The more effectively you manage your blood sugar levels, the lower your risk of developing diabetes complications. Diabetes complications often share causes and risk factors. Making changes to improve your overall health can also help reduce your chance of developing complications.

For people with diabetes, foot complications likeneuropathyand circulation problems can make it difficult for wounds to heal. Serious problems can arise from common skin issues like sores, cuts, and ulcers. In this article, we’ll look at the types of food problems that can occur in people with diabetes. We’ll also go over some tips for healthy feet. Diabetes that isn’t well managed can lead to slower healing. These slow-to-heal wounds can lead to infections. Other foot issues, likecalluses, are also common in people with diabetes. While calluses may not seem worrisome, if left untrimmed they can turn into ulcers or open sores. People with diabetes are also at risk forCharcot joint, a condition in which a weight-bearing joint progressively degenerates, leading to bone loss and deformity. Because of nerve damage, people with diabetes may not immediately notice that there are problems with their feet. Over time, people with diabetic neuropathy can develop foot problems that can’t be healed, which can lead to amputations. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of lower-extremity amputations in the United States. High blood sugar levels in people with diabetes can causeperipheral neuropathy, the medical term for numbness and loss of sensation due to damage to the nerves that serve the feet and hands. People with diabetic neuropathy can’t feel various sensations, like pressure or touch, as intensely as those without damage to their nerves. On the other hand, peripheral neuropathy is often very painful, causing burning, tingling, or other painful feelings in the feet. If a wound isn’t felt right away, it can go unchecked. Poor circulation can make it difficult for the body to heal these wounds. Infection can then set in and become so serious that amputation becomes necessary. Checking the feet for abnormalities is a very important part of diabetes care. Abnormalities may include: If you notice any of these symptoms, be sure to go to your doctor right away. In addition to keeping your blood sugar level within its target range, there are several steps that people with diabetes can take to prevent foot complications. To improve blood flow to the lower extremities, people with diabetes should walk as regularly as possible in shoes or sneakers that are: Exercising also reduces hypertension and keeps weight down, which is crucial. Another important part of preventive care is for your doctor to check your feet every visit and test them for touch sensation once per year.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. There are three main types of diabetes, all of which involve how your body uses or makes a hormone known as insulin to regulate your blood sugar levels. These can develop for different reasons. Treatment and management can vary, but they overlap in certain ways. There are different causes tied to the different diabetes types. While genetics is a key part of diabetes development,other risk factorsplay a role in diabetes, depending on the type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D)is an autoimmune condition, which means your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. This cannot be reversed. What prompts the attacks is not clear. There may be both genetic and environmental reasons. Lifestyle factors are not believed to play a role. Many adults may receive a T1D diagnosis, or what is known aslatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). This is also referred to as type 1.5. LADA may not develop as suddenly as T1D, and that delayed onset, coupled with adult age can lead to a misdiagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Make sure to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare and diabetes team, including any treatments you have that may not work as well as you’d expect them to. Type 2 diabetes (T2D)starts out as insulin resistance. This means your body cannot use insulin efficiently, which causes your pancreas to produce more insulin until it cannot keep up with demand. Insulin production then decreases, which causes high blood sugar. The exact cause of T2D is unknown. Contributing factors may include: There may also be other health factors and environmental reasons. Gestational diabetesis caused by insulin-blocking hormones produced during pregnancy. This type of diabetes only happens during pregnancy. It is often seen in people with preexisting prediabetes and a family history of diabetes. General symptoms of unmanaged diabetes include: T2D can cause discolored patches in the folds of skin in your armpits and neck. Since T2D usually takes longer to diagnose, you may feel more symptoms at the time of diagnosis, like pain or numbness in your feet. T1D often develops more quickly and can cause symptoms like weight loss ordiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can occur when you have very high blood sugar but little or no insulin in your body. Symptoms of both types of diabetes can appear at any age, but type 1 usually appears in children and young adults. Type 2 has historically been diagnosed in older adults. But younger people are increasingly receiving T2D diagnoses due to sedentary lifestyles and an increase in weight. About38 million peoplein the United States have diabetes. Most of those people have T2D, while only about 10% have T1D. Beyond those with diabetes,1 in 3 peoplein the United States have prediabetes. But most people withprediabetesdo not know they have the condition. Prediabetes develops when your blood glucose is higher than it should be but not high enough to be diabetes. You’re more likely to develop diabetes if you have a family history of the disease. Other T2Drisk factorsinclude: Complications of diabetes generally develop over time. Having poorly managed blood sugar levels increases the risk of serious complications that can become life threatening. Chronic complications include: T2D may increase the risk of developingAlzheimer’s disease, especially if your blood sugar is not well managed. High blood sugar levels during pregnancy can increase the risk of: No matter what type of diabetes you have, you’ll need to work closely with your doctor to manage it. The main goal is to keep blood glucose levels within your target range. Your doctor will let you know what your target range should be. Targets vary with the type of diabetes, age, and presence of complications. If you have gestational diabetes, your blood sugar targets will belowerthan those of people with other types of diabetes. Physical activity is an important part of diabetes management. Ask your doctor how many minutes you should devote to aerobic exercise per week. Diet is also important. You’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol. All people with T1D must take insulin to live since damage to the pancreas is permanent. Different types of insulin are available with different onset, peak, and duration times. Insulin is injected just under the skin. Your doctor will show you how to properly inject and rotate injection sites. You can also use an insulin pump, which is a device worn outside your body that can be programmed to release a specific dose. Continuous blood glucose monitors (CGMs) can also check your blood sugar 24 hours a day and night. You’ll need to monitor your blood sugar levels throughout the day. If necessary, you may also need to take medication to manage cholesterol, high blood pressure, or other complications. T2D can be managed and sometimes even reversed with diet and exercise. It can also be treated with a variety of medications to help manage blood sugar. The first-line medication is usuallymetformin(Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet, Riomet). This medication works by reducing glucose production in the liver. If metformin does not work, your doctor can prescribe another medication. You’ll need to continuously monitor your blood sugar levels. You may also need medications to help manage blood pressure and cholesterol. There’s no cure for T1D. It requires lifelong disease management. But with consistent monitoring and adherence to treatment, you may be able to avoid more serious complications of the disease. If you work closely with your doctor and make healthy lifestyle choices, T2D can often be successfully managed or even reversed. If you have gestational diabetes, it will likely resolve after the baby is born. However, you do have a higher risk of developing T2D later in life.

Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can develop if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It’s caused by damage to a part of your eye called the retina, which is important for vision. While you may start out with only mild vision problems, some people can eventually lose their eyesight. But the good news is thatvision lossfrom diabetic retinopathy is often preventable. The retina is the tissue that lines the back of your eye. Signals sent from the retina to the brain allow you to see. Diabetes affects the retina when high blood sugar levels cause damage to its blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of preventable blindness in the United States, according to theAmerican Diabetes Association. It’s also the most common eye disease in people with diabetes. If you have diabetes, it’s important to get regular exams from aneye doctor. With early diagnosis and treatment, it’s possible to stop complications before they happen. There arefour stagesof diabetic neuropathy. Together, the first 3 stages are known as nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (sometimes shortened to NPDR). It’s called “nonproliferative” because the eye doesn’t make new blood vessels during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. Nonproliferative retinopathy is also known as background retinopathy. During the early stages of retinopathy, you might not notice problems with your vision, but your eye doctor will usually be able to detect changes to your retina. There are 3 nonproliferative stages of retinopathy: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), or advanced retinopathy, occurs when new, abnormal blood vessels begin to grow inside the eye. When the retina loses nourishment, it signals the body to grow new blood vessels. These abnormal vessels may also grow into thecenter of the eye. These changes can cause vision loss in several ways: Minor bleeding can cause symptoms like dark spots and lines in your vision. Major bleeding can cause severe vision loss. This can includeblindness, or the total loss of vision. It’s important to seek treatment if you have diabetes and notice changes in your vision, like seeing cobwebs or floaters. Even if the problem seems to go away on its own, treatment is critical to prevent more serious vision loss from happening in the future. It’s uncommon to have symptoms during the early stages of this condition. The symptoms of diabetic retinopathy often don’t appear until major damage occurs inside of the eye. You can prevent unseen damage by managing your blood sugar levels and getting regular eye exams to monitor your eye health. When the symptoms do appear, they can include: Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both of your eyes. High levels ofblood sugarover long periods cause diabetic retinopathy. This excess sugar damages the blood vessels that supply the retina with blood.High blood pressureis also a risk factor for retinopathy. The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye. It’s sensitive to light, and when light enters your eye, it sends nerve signals to the brain. In the brain, those signals are translated into what you see. When blood vessels of the retina are damaged, they can become blocked, which cuts off some of the retina’s blood supply. This loss of blood flow can cause other, weaker blood vessels to grow. These new blood vessels can leak and create scar tissue that can cause a loss of vision. It’s hard to say exactly how many people with diabetes will develop retinopathy. In a 2016 study,44 percentof people with diabetes had retinopathy, while a 2017 study reported24.5 percent. The longer you have diabetes, the higher your chances of developing diabetic retinopathy become. Keeping your diabetes under control can help slow the progression. People with preexisting diabetes who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam to determine if they have signs of retinopathy. This is because retinopathy can worsen rapidly during pregnancy. Your doctor can diagnose diabetic retinopathy using adilated eye exam. This involves the use ofeye dropsthat make the pupils open wide, allowing your doctor to get a good look at the inside of your eye. Your doctor will check for: For a detailed look at your eye, your doctor can use one of the following tests: People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should see an eye doctor on a regular basis, once every1 to 2 years. If signs of diabetic retinopathy are detected, your doctor will likely recommend more frequent exams. Treatment for early diabetic retinopathy is focused on monitoring your eye health and managing your diabetes. Your doctor will likely recommend regular eye exams so that changes to your retina can be caught early. Your primary care physician or anendocrinologistcan also help to slow these changes by helping you manage your blood sugar and general health with diabetes. In advanced diabetic retinopathy, the treatment depends on the type of damage and severity of retinopathy. Treatment options include injections, laser treatments, and surgery. Injectable medications called anti-VEGF drugs work by blocking a protein that causes the growth of new, leaky blood vessels. These medications may also reduce swelling in the eye. These effects can improve your vision. Anti-VEGF medications include: These medications must be injected by a doctor, who will first numb your eye to reduce any discomfort. This treatment usually requires injectionsevery month, though over time you may need them less often, or not at all. Laser treatment, also known as photocoagulation, can help prevent vision loss. This type of surgery uses a laser to shrink or seal the blood vessels. Your doctor will first use a local anesthetic so you’ll be comfortable during the procedure. They’ll also use medication to dilate your pupil. Then, your doctor will use laser equipment to shine a light into your eye. There are two types of laser treatment used to treat diabetic retinopathy: It can sometimes take more than one session for laser treatment to be effective. A surgical procedure,vitrectomy, involves removing the gel inside your eye, called vitreous fluid. This allows your doctor to clear away cloudy fluid that’s affecting your vision. They can also access your retina to make repairs to blood vessels or remove scar tissue. Talk with your doctor about options to make you comfortable during the surgery. Your doctor can use medication to numb your eye orgeneral anesthesiaso that you’ll be unconscious during the procedure. If you have diabetes, you can prevent diabetic retinopathy by taking steps to keep your blood vessels healthy: Other ways to prevent or manage the condition include the following: Diabetic retinopathy can cause several other serious eye problems. These include diabetic macular edema (DME), neovascular glaucoma, and retinal detachment. Diabetic macular edema (DME) happens when the center of the retina, or macula, begins to swell. Because the macula is important to precise vision,diabetic macular edematends to make your vision blurry. It’s a fairly common complication among people with diabetes, affecting about1 in 15people with the condition. In advanced diabetic retinopathy, the growth of abnormal blood vessels can sometimes block fluid from draining out of the eye. When fluid can’t drain, this causes neovascular glaucoma. Symptoms include pressure and pain in your eye. Retinopathy can cause scar tissue to form on your retina. Sometimes the scar tissue can pull the retina away from the back of your eye. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency that can cause permanent vision loss. Warning signs ofretinal detachmentinclude: If you suspect retinal detachment, it’s important to seek medical care immediately by calling emergency services or having someone help you to the nearest emergency department. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition that can lead to diminished eyesight or even blindness in those with diabetes. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent it and slow its progression. If your doctor has diagnosed you with diabetes, it’s important to do the following: Because it’s possible to have diabetic retinopathy and not know it, it’s important for people with diabetes to keep up with regular eye exams. If you have diabetes and notice changes in your eyesight, it could be a sign of diabetic neuropathy.
